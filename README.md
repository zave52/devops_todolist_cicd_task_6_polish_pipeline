# Django ToDo list

This is a to-do list web application with the basic features of most web apps, such as accounts/login, API, and interactive UI. 
To complete this task, you will need:

- CSS | [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)
- JS  | [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

## Explore

Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine (requires Python 3.8 or higher due to compatibility with Django 4):


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a database schema:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

And then start the server (default is <http://localhost:8000>):

```
python manage.py runserver
```

You can now browse the [API](http://localhost:8000/api/) or start on the [landing page](http://localhost:8000/).
